                <h2>IPL 2023 Points table, Orange and Purple Cap list after CSK vs LSG: MS Dhoni and Co. climb to 6th spot</h2>
                <p>posted 10 hours ago (sports)</p>
                <p class="text">"Four-time champions Chennai Super Kings (CSK) returned to winning ways in the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2023 with 
                    an impressive win over Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) in match No.6 of the cash-rich league at Chepauk. Playing their first home game 
                    in almost four years, MS Dhoni's Chennai outclassed KL Rahul's LSG side in the high-scoring contest at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.
                    Batting first in their first home game of the new season, four-time winners Chennai posted a massive total against Lucknow at 
                    Chepauk. The opening pair of Ruturaj Gaikwad and Devon Conway laid the foundation for a gigantic total at Chepauk. Gaikwad's quick-fire
                     57 off 31 balls and Conway's 47-run knock followed by cameos from Shivam Dube (27) and Ambati Rayudu (27*) lifted CSK to 217-7 in 20 overs.
                      In reply, LSG mustered 205-7 as Rahul and Co. lost the match by 12 runs at Chepauk."</p>

                <h2>Finland joins NATO, dealing blow to Russia for Ukraine war</h2>
                <p>posted 12 hrs ago (World Affairs)</p>
                <p class="text"> "BRUSSELS (AP) — Finland joined the NATO military alliance Tuesday, dealing a major blow to Russia with a historic realignment 
                    of the continent triggered by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.The Nordic country’s membership doubles Russia’s border with the world’s
                    biggest security alliance and represents a major change in Europe’s security landscape: The nation adopted neutrality after its defeat 
                    by the Soviets in World War II. But its leaders signaled they wanted to join the alliance just months after Russian President Vladimir 
                    Putin’s invasion of Ukraine sent a shiver of fear through Moscow’s neighbors.The move is a strategic and political blow to Putin, 
                    who has long complained about NATO’s expansion toward Russia and partly used that as a justification for the invasion."</p>
